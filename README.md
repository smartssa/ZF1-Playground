ZF1-Playground
==============

playground consists of demo code from a few years ago.

All Zend Framework 1 related, with a few bonus pieces of random things in the public folder.

There's some websockets, ajaxy stuff, navigation, routes, caching, sessions, forms, and whatever...

It's free to use, all yours to do as you please. Perhaps something is useful.
